    "abstract": "Model-based development is becoming an increasingly com- mon development methodology. In important domains like embedded systems already major parts of the code are gener- ated from models speci ed with domain-speci c modelling languages. Hence, such models are nowadays an integral part of the software development and maintenance process and therefore have a major economic and strategic value for the software-developing organisations. Nevertheless almost no work has been done on a quality defect that is known to seriously hamper maintenance productivity in classic code- based development: Cloning . This paper presents an ap- proach for the automatic detection of clones in large mod- els as they are used in model-based development of con- trol systems. The approach is based on graph theory and hence can be applied to most graphical data- ow languages. An industrial case study demonstrates the applicability of our approach for the detection of clones in MatlabSimulink models that are wid...",

As they are mainly described innatural language, relatively few means of automated qualityassessment exist.

    "abstract": "Software released in binary form frequently uses third-party packages without respecting their licensing terms. For in- stance, many consumer devices have ﬁrmware containing the Linux kernel, without the suppliers following the require- ments of the GNU General Public License. Such license violations are often accidental, e.g., when vendors receive binary code from their suppliers with no indication of its provenance. To help ﬁnd such violations, we have developed theBinary Analysis Tool (BAT), a system for code clone detection in binaries. Given a binary, such as a ﬁrmware image, it attempts to detect cloning of code from reposito- ries of packages in source and binary form. We evaluate and compare the eﬀectiveness of three of BATs clone detection techniques: scanning for string literals, detecting similarity through data compression, and detecting similarity by com- puting binary deltas.

    "abstract": "Finding, understanding and managing software clones  pass ages of dupli- cated source code  is of large interest, as research shows. Ho wever, most methods for detecting clones are limited to a single revisio n of a program. To gain more insight into the impact of clones, their evoluti on has to be understood. Current investigations on the evolution of clo nes detect clones for diﬀerent revisions separately and correlate them after wards. This thesis presents an incremental clone detection algori thm, which detects clones in multiple revisions of a program. It creates a mappi ng between clones of one revision to the next, supplying information ab out the addition, deletion or modiﬁcation of clones. The algorithm uses token -based clone detection and requires less time than using an existing appr oach to detect clones in each revision separately. The implementation of t he algorithm has been tested with large scale software systems. Contents 1 Introduction 1",

We evaluated our novel learning-based approach for code clone detection with respect to feasibility from the point of view of software maintainers.

Several studies show that about 5 to 20 of a software systems can contain duplicated code, which is basically the results of copying existing code fragments and using then by pasting with or without minor modications. One of the major shortcomings of such duplicated fragments is that if a bug is detected in a code fragment, all the other fragments similar to it should be investigated to check the possible existence of the same bug in the similar fragments. Refactoring of the duplicated code is another prime issue in software maintenance although several studies claim that refactoring of certain clones are not desirable and there is a risk of removing them. However, it is also widely agreed that clones should at least be detected. In this paper, we survey the state of the art in clone detection research. First, we describe the clone te...",

Consequently, there is a strong need to investigate the latest techniques, trends, and tools in the domain of CCD. Therefore, in this paper, we comprehensively inspect the latest tools and techniques utilized for the detection of code clones. Particularly, a systematic literature review (SLR) is performed to select and investigate 54 studies pertaining to CCD. Consequently, six categories are de ned to incorporate the selected studies as per relevance, i.e., textual approaches (12), lexical approaches (8), tree- based approaches (3), metric-based appr...",

Likewise, duplicated parts of models are problem- atic in model-based development. Recently, we and other authors proposed multiple approaches to automatically iden- tify duplicates in graphical models. While it has been demon- strated that these approaches work in principal, a number of challenges remain for application in industrial practice. Based on an industrial case study undertaken with the BMW Group, this paper details on these challenges and presents solutions to the most pressing ones, namely scalability and relevance of the results.

Clone management, its beneﬁtsand cross cutting nature is reported. Number of studies pertain...",

    "abstract": "Despite a decade of active research, there has been a marked lack in clone detection techniques that scale to large repos- itories for detecting near-miss clones. In this paper, we present a token-based clone detector, SourcererCC, that can detect both exact and near-miss clones from large inter- project repositories using a standard workstation. It ex- ploits an optimized inverted-index to quickly query the po- tential clones of a given code block. Filtering heuristics based on token ordering are used to signi cantly reduce the size of the index, the number of code-block comparisons needed to detect the clones, as well as the number of re- quired token-comparisons needed to judge a potential clone. We evaluate the scalability, execution time, recall and preci- sion of SourcererCC, and compare it to four publicly avail- able and state-of-the-art tools. To measure recall, we use two recent benchmarks: (1) a big benchmark of real clones, BigCloneBench, and (2) a MutationInjection-based f...",

    "abstract": "If two fragments of source code are identical or similar to each other, they are called code clones. Code clones introduce difﬁcul- ties in software maintenance and cause bug propagation. Software clones occur due to several reasons such as code reuse by copying pre-existing fragments, coding style, and repeated computation us- ing duplicated functions with slight changes in variables or data structures used. If a code fragment is edited, it will have to be checked against all related code clones to see if they need to be modiﬁed as well. Removal, avoidance or refactoring of cloned code are other important issues in software maintenance. However, sev- eral research studies have demonstrated that removal or refactoring of cloned code is sometimes harmful. In this study, code clones, common types of clones, phases of clone detection, the state-of- the-art in code clone detection techniques and tools, and challenges faced by clone detection techniques are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Many clone detection tools have been proposed in the literature. However, our knowledge of their performance in real software systems is limited, particularly their recall. We pre-viously introduced our BigCloneBench, a big clone benchmark of over 8 million clones within a large inter-project Java repository containing 25,000 open-source Java systems. In this paper wepresent BigCloneEval, a framework for evaluating clone detection tools with BigCloneBench. BigCloneEval makes it very easy for clone detection researchers to evaluate and compare clonedetection tools. It automates the execution and evaluation of clone detection tools against the reference clones of BigCloneBench, and summarizes recall performance from a variety of perspectives, including per clone type, and per syntactical similarity regions. I. I NTRODUCTION Clone detection tools locate similar source code within or between software systems. Instances of similar code fragments are called clones. Developers create clones w...",

    "abstract": "The NiCad Clone Detector is a scalable, ﬂexible clone detection tool designed to implement the NiCad (Au- tomated Detection of Near-Miss Intentional Clones) hybrid clone detection method in a convenient, easy-to-use command- line tool that can easily be embedded in IDEs and other environments. It takes as input a source directory or directories to be checked for clones and a conﬁguration ﬁle specifying the normalization and ﬁltering to be done, and provides output results in both XML form for easy analysis and HTML form for convenient browsing. NiCad handles a range of languages and normalizations, and is designed to be easily extensible using a component-based plugin architecture. It is scalable to very large systems and has been used to analyze, for example, all 47 releases of FreeBSD (60 million lines) as a single system.",
