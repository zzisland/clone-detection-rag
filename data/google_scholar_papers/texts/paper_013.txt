## 摘要
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has become an im- portant development framework for many large-scale soft- ware. Previous research has reported that as in traditional code-based development, cloning also occurs in MDE. However, there has been little work on clone detection in models with the limitations on detection precision and com- pleteness. This paper presents ModelCD , a novel clone detection tool for MatlabSimulink models, that is able to efﬁciently and accurately detect both exactly matched and approximate model clones. The core of ModelCD is two novel graph-based clone detection algorithms that are able to systematically and incrementally discover clones with a high degree of completeness, accuracy, and scalability. We have conducted an empirical evaluation with various exper- imental studies on many real-world systems to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach and to compare the perfor- mance of ModelCD with existing tools. 1 Introduction Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has ...
