## 摘要
Due to their pivotal role in software engineering, consider- able eﬀort is spent on the quality assurance of software re-quirements speciﬁcations. As they are mainly described innatural language, relatively few means of automated qualityassessment exist. However, we found that clone detection , a technique widely applied to source code, is promising toassess one important quality aspect in an automated way,namely redundancy that stems from copypaste operations.This paper describes a large-scale case study that applied clone detection to 28 requirements speciﬁcations with a to- tal of 8,667 pages. We report on the amount of redundancyfound in real-world speciﬁcations, discuss its nature as well as its consequences and evaluate in how far existing code clone detection approaches can be applied to assess the qual- ity of requirements speciﬁcations in practice.
