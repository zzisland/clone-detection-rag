## 摘要
Model-based development is becoming an increasingly com- mon development methodology. In important domains like embedded systems already major parts of the code are gener- ated from models speci ed with domain-speci c modelling languages. Hence, such models are nowadays an integral part of the software development and maintenance process and therefore have a major economic and strategic value for the software-developing organisations. Nevertheless almost no work has been done on a quality defect that is known to seriously hamper maintenance productivity in classic code- based development: Cloning . This paper presents an ap- proach for the automatic detection of clones in large mod- els as they are used in model-based development of con- trol systems. The approach is based on graph theory and hence can be applied to most graphical data- ow languages. An industrial case study demonstrates the applicability of our approach for the detection of clones in MatlabSimulink models that are wid...
