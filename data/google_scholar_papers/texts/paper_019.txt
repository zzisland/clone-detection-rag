## 摘要
Context: Reusing software by means of copy and paste is a frequent activity in software development. The duplicated code is known as a software clone and the activity is known as code cloning . Software clones may lead to bug propagation and serious maintenance problems. Objective: This study reports an extensive systematic literature review of software clones in general and software clone detection in particular. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method based on a comprehensive set of 213 articles from a total of 2039 articles published in 11 leading journals and 37 premier conferences andworkshops.Results: Existing literature about software clones is classiﬁed broadly into different categories. The importance of semantic clone detection and model based clone detection led to different classiﬁcations. Empirical evaluation of clone detection toolstechniques is presented. Clone management, its beneﬁtsand cross cutting nature is reported. Number of studies pertain...
