## 摘要
Code clone detection is an important problem for software maintenance and evolution. Many approaches consider ei- ther structure or identiﬁers, but none of the existing detec- tion techniques model bothsources of information. These techniques also depend on generic, handcrafted features to represent code fragments. We introduce learning-based de- tection techniques where everything for representing terms and fragments in source code is mined from the repository. Our code analysis supports a framework, which relies on deep learning, for automatically linking patterns mined at the lexical level with patterns mined at the syntactic level. We evaluated our novel learning-based approach for code clone detection with respect to feasibility from the point of view of software maintainers. We sampled and manually evaluated 398 ﬁle- and 480 method-level pairs across eight real-world Java systems; 93 of the ﬁle- and method-level samples were evaluated to be true positives. Among the true positive...
